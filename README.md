### Summary

This class covers fundamental data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques at the core of computer science. Students will learn how to estimate theoretical performance of a programmatic solution and choose optimal solutions for common programming problems.

Students should have experience with object-oriented programming in Java through IT 211 or a similar course with 2.0 or higher.

### Requirements

This course will use **Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 2nd Edition**, by Robert Lafore as a textbook, along with supplementary online materials.

Students can access this textbook free online through https://libguides.seattlecentral.edu/az.php?a=o using these steps:

- In the ‘Select institution’ drop-down menu, select “not listed”
- Enter your *@seattlecolleges.edu* email address.

Students will perform extensive hands-on development throughout the course and will require;

- A computer onto which they can install software,
- A working internet connection
- A syntax-highlighting text editor
- A https://www.coursera.org account
- A https://www.codestepbystep.com/ account
- A https://leetcode.com/ account

**Note** - https://replit.com/ provides free browser-based Java development environments.



### Class Structure & topics

Course instruction will be virtual with weekly video sessions at the scheduled class time to review assigned topics and address questions. Students should complete assigned readings & videos prior to class.

Students can reach me directly throughout the week in the SCC IT Slack channel.

This course will cover the following topics, although the precise list & order is subject to revision:

* Analysis of Algorithms
* Abstract Data Types
* Recursion
* Linked lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Sorting algorithms
* Hashing
* Binary search trees
* Hash Tables
* Graphs and path finding
* Data Compression


### Grading

Grades will be based on assignments (85%) and quizzes (15%). There is no final exam.

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas and are designed to exercise the skill and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the Monday before class and late submissions may be subject to a 10% penalty. Assignments turned in more than 2 weeks late will not be accepted nor graded.

### ADA Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in Rm. 1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS you will be given a letter of accommodation that should be handed to your instructor
